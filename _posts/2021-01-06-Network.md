## Physical Layer to Data Link Layer
Based on Ethernet protocol(A group of electrical signals that are grouped together), the physical layer will send data by 0 and 1. Data link layer will 'package' these data into frame by Head and Data. 

Head: who send? who recieve? data type? (18 bytes)

Data: contents (46~1500 bytes)

Mac address: physical address for equipment (Unique, 12 position - hexadecimal)

Broadcasting: in the subnet, one network card call another one.

## Network layer: judge whether different equipments are located in the same subnet (establish a host-to-host connection ‘equipments’)

Routing: send data package to different subnet rather than broadcasting.

Mac address does not have any relationship with ip address (distrubuted by administrator); IP address first, then Mac address --- IP protocol

IP protocol: 

1. sign a ip address to different equipments

2. make which computers are located in the same subnet

IP data packets (~65535 bytes): Head & Data

Head: version number, length, IP address (20~60 bytes)

Data: which will be appended in the Ethernet data (~65535 - 20 = 65515); if IP data packets are over Ethernet protocol limitation, it will need to send separately. (many data packages)

ARP protocol:

1. in the same subnet: broadcasting to other equipment to match ip address, which hidden in Ethernet protocol. It will get response from the same IP address (the Mac address of host & IP address).

2. in the different subnet: go to gateway (the Mac address of gateway & IP address)

Port(Each uses a network card program number) (0~65535):

judge which application will use this Internet data package; (0~1023 is occupied by the system, the computer will assign a port to one application and communicate this port with server to receive signal)

## Transport Layer (TCP/UDP): establish a port-to-port connection

Only if we know host and port, application can connect with each other. Unix system call 'socket': host + port

UDP: head + data (~65535 includes one IP data package); put the whole UDP data package to IP data parts

head: send port + receive port (8 bytes)

data: contents

TCP: confirm receipt(our data wont loss, if loss, it will send again) + UDP (three times handshake); TCP/UCP is nested in the IP package data part; TCP data package does not have limitaion in the length (normally, the length will not be longer than IP data package) 

The comparsion with TCP and UCP:
<table border="1" align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>TCP</th>
        <th>UDP</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>connection oriented</td>
        <td>connectionless</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>provide reliable service</td>
        <td>no guarantee of reliability</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>point-to-point</td>
        <td>strong real time, one to one, many to one, many to many</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Higher resource consumption</td>
        <td>lower resource consumption</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Application Layer: specify the data format of the application

Dynamic IP address (it is not a static IP address):
Based on Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP), DHCP server will assign IP address to the hosts which located in the subnet. 


### What about a new machine is added to the system?
DHCP is over UDP

Ethernet Header + IP Header + UDP Header + DHCP data package

Ethernet Header: Mac address (send + recieve) (sender MAC address + broadcasting address: FF:FF:FF:FF)

IP Header: IP address (send + recieve) (0.0.0.0 + 255.255.255.255)

UDP Header: port (send + recieve) (68 + 67)

It will broadcast info to all the subset equipments. When it checks IP address 0.0.0.0 + 255.255.255.255, it knows this package is sending to DHCP server. Then, DHCP has a DHCP response. Then, this new computer will know its IP address, subnet mask, gateway address...

## The example of RUNNING

a website: www.youtube.com --> DNS protocol (get target IP address) by port 53 --> data package (Ethernet Header + IP Header + UDP Header + DNS data package) : get IP address + port

obtained target IP address + port--> judge whether there are in the same subnet by subnet mask --> if not --> sent data package to gateway to transpond(router)

HTTP protocol: data package(Ethernet Header + IP Header + TCP Header + HTTP data package)

TCP layer: includes both port, 80 in the server and send port (any one 1024~66535); TCP header(20 bytes) + inserted in HTTP data package (4960) = 4980

IP layer: includes both ip address; IP header (20 bytes) + inserted in TCP data package (4960) = 4980

Ethernet layer: includes both Mac address; ethernet data package (1500 < 5000), thus this one will be splited by four to: 1500, 1500, 1500, 500 bytes

-------
Server combined 4 data package based IP header to get full information --> respond a package to us by TCP, browser will interpret it.

## TCP and UDP?
UDP: Broadcasting.... Due to coronavirus, city shut down! you must stay at home!

TCP: You've been quarantined by the hotel! You are targeted by cop!

## TCP Three Times HandShake
Host : A and Server : B
A: hey man, how are you?
B: Fine, thank you! and you?
A: I'm good!

**connection established**
A: too late! my mom phoned me to go home for dinner.
B: yeah, me as well.
B: Bye?
A: Bye~
